Hi welcome to my home-page. I am a norwegian singer, pianoplayer and songwriter living in Gotland, Sweden. Currently I am working as a music teacher, singing-instructor and a musician. 

Musical background: I have a wide range of musical background and over the years I have experienced all kinds of gengres, including jazz, rock, metal, electronica, musicals and even classical music. In 1995 I gave out an album with my current band Funeral (doom metal), and after that I had some years of music education and professional work in the musical and performance-stages of Oslo. 

Growing up in a musical family, I was introduced to a lot of pop and rock from an early age. The last decade jazz has become more and more important to me, and I am mainly focusing on that, although my own music is a mix of several gengres. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/75f7bddf-2192-42c4-ad2e-f6fd2777cfaf.jpg)
